    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a detail-oriented Frontend Developer and Software Engineering student
      with a passion for learning and helping others. When I'm not working on
      projects or studying, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others through
      mentorship and teaching. In my free time, I like to relax by reading,
      playing strategy games, and engaging in conversations about personal
      growth and self-improvement. I'm always up for trying new things and
      connecting with like-minded individuals who share my curiosity and
      enthusiasm for life.
